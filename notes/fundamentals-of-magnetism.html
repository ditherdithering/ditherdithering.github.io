        <h2>Magnetism</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Ability for magnets to attract other magnetic materials
            <ul>
            <li>They are also called magnets</li>
            <li>May be natural or artificial</li>
            <li>Common example: magnetite, lodestone</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Magnetic Materials</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Those attracted by magnets</li>
        <li>Examples: iron, nickel, cobalt, metal alloys</li>
        <li>Some artificial magnets can be made using magnetic materials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Non-magnetic Materials</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Examples: wood, paper, glass, plastic</li>
        <li>Cannot be attracted by magnets or made using magnetic materials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>William Sturgeon</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Produced the first electromagnet (EM) in 1825</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Poles</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Portions of a magnet found at ends where the magnetic force is the greatest</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Magnetization</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Process of making materials temporarily or permanently magnetic</li>
        <li>Can be achieved with:
            <ul>
            <li>Stroking it with a permanent magnet in one direction</li>
            <li>Allowing an electric current to pass through</li>
            <li>Induction from Earth's magnetism
                <ul>
                <li>The magnetic material is brought near a strong magnet's pole in induction</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Magnetic poles induce a like pole at the far end of the material and an unlike pole in the end adjacent to it</li>
        <li>The material loses magnetism once the strong magnet is removed</li>
        <li>Magnetites magnetize due to being exposed to Earth's magnetic field for a long time</li>
        <li>EMs are human-made and are created using electric current</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Magnetic Field (MF)</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Surrounds a magnet</li>
        <li>A region of space where a magnet exerts force on a magnetic material</li>
        <li>Analogous to the electric field (EF) around an electric charge (EC)</li>
        <li>MFs can be mapped using paper, bar magnets, and magnetic filings/dust</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Jose Guardo Jr.</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Developed maglevs
            <ul>
            <li>Can run at 200 km/h</li>
            <li>Uses NdFeB</li>
            <li>The magnets provide the repulsive force from the lower part of the coach to levitate</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>More on Magnetism</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Similar to electricity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wilhelm Eduard Weber</h2>
        <p>A German physicist, theorized that each atom of a magnetic material is a magnet in itself. These atoms arrange themselves into groups called magnetic domains. The magnetic properties of a material depend on how these domains are arranged.</p>

        <h2>Hans Christian Oersted</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Danish physicist</li>
        <li>Shown that a moving charge produces a magnetic field
            <ul>
            <li>The electron is a charged particle that spins about its axis as it revolves around the nucleus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Moving and spinning electrons are sources of magnetism according to the modern theory of magnetism
            <ul>
            <li>The electron is the smallest possible magnet</li>
            <li>If an atom has an equal number of electrons spinning in opposite directions, the magnetic fields cancel out and the atom is unmagnetized</li>
            <li>If there are more electrons spinning in one direction, the atom is magnetized</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Magnetic Materials</h2>

        <h3>Ferromagnetic Materials</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Strongly attracted by a magnet</li>
        <li>Examples: iron, cobalt, nickel</li>
        <li>Contain unpaired electrons, giving magnetic properties even without an external magnetic field</li>
        <li>In a magnetic field, magnetic domains align, producing a strong magnetic field</li>
        <li>Lose magnetic properties when heated to high temperatures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Paramagnetic Materials</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Have net magnetic moments due to unpaired electrons</li>
        <li>Weakly attracted to magnets</li>
        <li>Examples: transition metals like palladium, platinum, and actinides</li>
        <li>Become more magnetic when cooled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diamagnetic Materials</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Weakly respond to a magnetic field</li>
        <li>Magnetization exists only with an external magnetic field</li>
        <li>Magnetic domains align opposite to the applied magnetic field</li>
        <li>Repelled by a magnetic field</li>
        <li>Examples: metals, nonmetals, organic compounds</li>
        <li>Independent of temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Curie Point</h2>
        <p>The temperature at which a magnetic material loses its magnetism is called the Curie temperature (or Curie point). The Curie temperature for cobalt, iron, and nickel are 1131°C, 770°C, and 358°C, respectively.</p>

        <h2>Geomagnetism</h2>
        <p>Earth itself is the biggest magnet. Earth's magnetism is due to the motion of charged particles in its liquid outer core. Earth's rotation produces moving charged particles, creating a magnetic field. Earth's magnetism is also referred to as geomagnetism.</p>
