        <h2 id="freedom-of-choice">Freedom of Choice</h2>
        <p>We are all making a choice. Everything we do or say in life is a choice.</p>
        <p>Aristotle distinguished man as the only rational animal.
        That means:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Humans alone possess the faculty of reason</li>
        <li>Reason gives us awareness of our freedom of choice
        John Kavanaugh - Freedom of choice comes with its ambiguity, deliberation, irrevocability, and the terror of making choices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be grounded in reasoning.</p>
