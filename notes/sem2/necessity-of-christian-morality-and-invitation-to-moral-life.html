        <p><sup>16</sup>Then someone came to him and said, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” <sup>17</sup>And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is one who is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.” <sup>18</sup>He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. <sup>19</sup>Honor your father and mother. Also, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.” <sup>20</sup>The young man said to him, “I have kept all these; what do I still lack?” <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.” <sup>22</sup>When the young man heard this word, he went away grieving, for he had many possessions.</p>
